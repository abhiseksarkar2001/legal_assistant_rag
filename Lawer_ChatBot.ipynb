      "Okay, so I need to figure out if a Christian woman can file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty in India. Let me start by looking at the law sections provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, Section 10 lists the grounds for dissolution of marriage. It includes cruelty as a ground in clause (x). That means cruelty is a valid reason for divorce under this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I should check if this applies to Christian women. Section 2 says the Act extends to the whole of India, including Jammu and Kashmir, so that's not an issue. But there's another part in Section 2 that talks about the court's power to grant relief only if the petitioner or respondent is Christian. So, the woman must be Christian for this section to apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at Section 22, it mentions that judicial separation can be obtained on grounds like cruelty. This supports the idea that cruelty is a recognized ground for legal action, though it's about separation, not divorce. But since Section 10 already covers divorce, that's more relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 498A is about criminal punishment for cruelty, but the user is asking about divorce, which is a civil matter. So while it's related, it's not directly answering the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, Section 10(1)(x) allows for divorce on cruelty, and as long as the woman is Christian, she can file under this section. So yes, she can file for divorce on cruelty grounds.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, a Christian woman can file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty in India under Section 10(1)(x) of the Indian Divorce Act, which specifically allows for dissolution of marriage due to cruelty. This provision applies to Christian women as per Section 2 of the Act, which extends the application of the law to Christians in India. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, a Christian woman can file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty in India. Under Section 10(1)(x) of the Indian Divorce Act, cruelty is a recognized ground for dissolution of marriage. Additionally, Section 2 of the Act confirms that the provisions apply to Christians in India. Therefore, she can petition for divorce citing cruelty as the reason.\n",
