Okay, so I need to figure out if the police can arrest someone without a warrant in a cognizable offence under Indian law. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that in criminal law, offences are categorized as cognizable and non-cognizable. Cognizable offences are more serious and allow the police to take certain actions without a warrant. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

Looking at the law sections provided, I see Section 151. It talks about a police officer arresting someone without a warrant if they know of a design to commit a cognizable offence. It says the officer can arrest if it seems the offence can't be prevented otherwise. Also, it mentions that the person can't be held for more than 24 hours unless other laws allow it.

Then there's Section 202, which allows a police officer in uniform to arrest without a warrant for specific offences like those under sections 184, 185, or 197. It also mentions that if the person is arrested under section 185, they must undergo a medical exam within two hours, or else be released.

Section 56 states that after an arrest without a warrant, the person must be taken before a magistrate or police officer in charge without unnecessary delay. This seems like a due process requirement.

Section 80 deals with executing a warrant outside the district, which might not be directly relevant here. Section 155 is about non-cognizable cases, so that's probably not applicable since the user is asking about cognizable offences.

Putting this together, it seems that the police do have the authority to arrest without a warrant in cognizable cases, especially under Section 151 when they believe a cognizable offence is about to be committed. Additionally, Section 202 provides specific instances where such arrests are permitted.

I should also consider if there are any exceptions or additional conditions. For example, Section 151 has a time limit for detention, and Section 202 requires a medical exam in certain cases. But the main point is that the police can indeed make warrantless arrests for cognizable offences under these sections.

So, the answer should cite these sections and confirm the police's authority, mentioning the specific conditions and limitations where applicable.

Yes, the police can arrest someone without a warrant in a cognizable offence under Indian law. 

**Citations:**
- **Section 151** of the Criminal Procedure Code allows a police officer to arrest without a warrant if they know of a design to commit a cognizable offence, provided it appears that the offence cannot otherwise be prevented. The person arrested cannot be detained beyond 24 hours unless further detention is authorized by law.
- **Section 202** also permits a police officer in uniform to arrest without a warrant for specific offences under sections 184, 185, or 197. If arrested under section 185, a medical examination is required within two hours, failing which the person must be released.

These sections confirm the police's authority to make warrantless arrests in cognizable cases, with specific conditions and limitations applied.
