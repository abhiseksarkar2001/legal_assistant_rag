Okay, so I need to figure out the punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with dangerous weapons under Indian law. Let me start by looking at the sections provided.

First, I see Section 326, which specifically mentions using dangerous weapons or means. It says that if someone causes grievous hurt with weapons like instruments for shooting, stabbing, cutting, or anything likely to cause death, they can be punished with life imprisonment or up to ten years in jail, plus a fine.

Then there's Section 325, which is a more general section about voluntarily causing grievous hurt without the use of dangerous weapons. The punishment here is up to seven years imprisonment and a fine.

Since the user is asking about dangerous weapons, Section 326 is the relevant one. It provides a harsher punishment compared to Section 325 because of the use of dangerous weapons, which increases the severity of the offense.

I should make sure to cite Section 326 exactly as it's the specific section dealing with dangerous weapons. The punishment includes life imprisonment or up to ten years, along with a fine. I don't need to consider other sections like 329 or 338 because they deal with different circumstances, like extorting property or endangering safety, which aren't mentioned in the query.

So, the answer should clearly state the punishment under Section 326, mentioning both the imprisonment terms and the fine.
