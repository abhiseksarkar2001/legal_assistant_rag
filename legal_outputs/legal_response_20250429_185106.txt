Okay, so I need to figure out what compensation a victim can get after a hit-and-run accident in India based on the provided law sections. Let me go through each section one by one to understand what they say about compensation in such cases.

First, looking at Section 161, it's about special provisions for hit-and-run accidents. Sub-section (1) says the Central Government will provide compensation through a scheme. Sub-section (2) specifies the amounts: 2 lakh rupees for death and 50k for grievous hurt. Sub-section (3) mentions that the Central Government can create a scheme to administer this, including how applications are made and processed. Sub-section (4) talks about interim relief and penalties for violating the scheme.

Next, Section 164B discusses the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund. It says this fund is for providing insurance to all road users. Sub-section (3) lists the uses of the fund, including treatment for injured, compensation for hit-and-run deaths and grievous hurt as per Section 161's schemes, and other prescribed compensations. Sub-section (4) notes that the maximum liability is as prescribed by the Central Government.

Section 164 is about compensation in case of death or grievous hurt. It sets a sum of 5 lakh for death and 2.5 lakh for grievous hurt. Importantly, the claimant doesn't need to prove negligence, which is a no-fault liability. It also mentions that if compensation was paid under another law, it's deducted from this amount.

Section 357B states that compensation from the State under Section 357A is in addition to any fine paid to the victim under certain IPC sections, but I'm not sure if this applies to hit-and-run cases unless the offender is also fined under those sections.

Section 357 allows the court to order compensation to victims as part of the sentence, but this seems more general and not specific to hit-and-run accidents.

Putting it all together, the primary sections for hit-and-run are 161 and 164B. Section 161 provides fixed sums, while Section 164B's fund supports this. Section 164 offers higher amounts but isn't specific to hit-and-run; it's more general for motor accidents. So, the specific compensation for hit-and-run would be under Section 161, with the amounts being 2 lakh for death and 50k for grievous hurt, funded through the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund under Section 164B.
