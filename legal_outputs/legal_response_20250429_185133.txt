5. Section 438 - Direction for grant of bail to person apprehending arrest
Where any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section that in the event of such arrest he shall be released on bail; and that Court may, after taking into consideration, inter-alia, the following factors, namely‚Äî

Provided that, where the High Court or, as the case may be, the Court of Session, has not passed any interim order under this Sub-Section or has rejected the application for grant of anticipatory bail, it shall be open to an officer in-charge of a police station to arrest, without warrant the applicant on the basis of the accusation apprehended in such application.

		Nothing in this section shall apply to any case involving the arrest of any person on accusation of having committed an offence under sub-section (3) of section 376 or section 376AB or section 376DA or section 376DB of the Indian Penal Code1.

‚öñÔ∏è Expert Legal Opinion:
<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the steps after an FIR is filed for assault. I need to figure out the legal process based on the provided sections. Let me go through each section one by one to see which ones apply.

First, looking at Section 239. It talks about discharging the accused if the charge is groundless. So after the FIR, the Magistrate would consider the police report and might discharge the accused if there's no basis.

Next, Section 134 is about abetment of assault by military personnel. It's a specific scenario, so unless the assault involves military officers, this might not apply. The user didn't specify, so maybe it's not relevant here.

Section 209 deals with committing the case to the Session Court if the offence is exclusively triable there. So if the assault is a serious offence, the Magistrate would commit the case to the Session Court.

Section 340 is about the court's procedure when an offence is related to giving false evidence. If the assault case involves perjury or fabricating evidence, the court can make a complaint and send it to a Magistrate.

Section 438 is about anticipatory bail. If the accused is apprehending arrest, they can apply for bail under this section. The court considers factors like the nature of the accusation and the applicant's background.

Putting it all together, after an FIR for assault, the police investigate and file a report. The Magistrate then reviews it. If the charge seems groundless, the accused is discharged (Section 239). If it's a serious offence, the case goes to the Session Court (Section 209). If there's an issue with evidence, the court might proceed under Section 340. The accused can apply for anticipatory bail under Section 438.

I should structure the answer step-wise, mentioning each applicable section and the possible outcomes based on the sections provided.
</think>

After an FIR is filed for assault, the following steps are taken based on the provided legal sections:

1. **Police Investigation and Report**: The police investigate the case and submit a report under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code (not directly provided here but referenced in Section 239).

2. **Magistrate's Review**: The Magistrate reviews the police report and documents. If the charge is deemed groundless, the Magistrate may discharge the accused under Section 239.

3. **Commitment to Session Court**: If the offence is triable exclusively by the Session Court, the Magistrate commits the case to the Session Court under Section 209.

4. **Court Proceedings**: The court may proceed under Section 340 if the offence relates to perjury or fabricating evidence during proceedings.

5. **Anticipatory Bail**: The accused may apply for anticipatory bail under Section 438 if they apprehend arrest, considering factors like the nature of the accusation and their background.

Each step depends on the specifics of the case, such as the severity of the assault and the evidence presented.
