4. Section 24 - Confession caused by inducement, threat or promise, when irrelevant in criminal proceeding
A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding, if the making of the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise1, having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him reasonable, for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

5. Section 29 - Confession otherwise relevant not to become irrelevant because of promise of secrecy, etc
If such a confession is otherwise relevant, it docs not become irrelevant merely because it was made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practiced on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered, whatever may have been the form of those questions, or because he was not warned that he was not bound to make such confession, and that evidence of it might be given against him.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a confession made to a police officer can be used as evidence in court under Indian law. Let me go through the provided law sections step by step.

First, I see Section 25 which clearly states that no confession made to a police officer shall be proved against the accused. That seems pretty straightforward. So, if someone confesses to a police officer, that confession can't be used as evidence against them.

Then there's Section 26, which says that a confession made while in police custody can't be used unless it's made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate. So even if the confession is made in custody, it's only admissible if a Magistrate is present.

Looking at Section 164, it explains how confessions should be recorded. It mentions that a Magistrate can record a confession, but only after ensuring it's voluntary. It also provides that such confessions must be recorded in a specific manner and that the person is informed of their rights. This reinforces that confessions to police aren't allowed, but if done through a Magistrate, they can be admissible.

Section 24 talks about confessions made under inducement, threat, or promise being irrelevant. So even if a confession is made to someone else, if it's coerced, it's not valid. But this doesn't directly answer the question about police officers.

Section 29 says that a confession doesn't become irrelevant just because of certain circumstances, like a promise of secrecy or intoxication. However, this doesn't override the earlier sections that prohibit confessions made to police officers from being used.

Putting it all together, the key point is Section 25, which explicitly prohibits the use of confessions made to police officers as evidence. The other sections support this by providing exceptions only when a Magistrate is involved and ensuring the voluntariness of the confession. Therefore, the answer is clear: such confessions can't be used as evidence.

No, a confession made to a police officer cannot be used as evidence in court. 

**Section 25** explicitly states that no confession made to a police officer shall be proved against the accused. Additionally, **Section 26** prohibits the use of confessions made while in police custody unless in the immediate presence of a Magistrate. **Section 164** outlines the proper procedure for recording confessions through a Magistrate, ensuring voluntariness and proper documentation. 

Thus, under Indian law, confessions to police officers are inadmissible as evidence.
